        <p>
          Our business formation and incorporation service (also known as
          “Firstbase StartTM” is offered to our Firstbase.io customers. It
          allows our users to form a legal entity in the United States and
          obtain necessary documents and resources to build a business or
          company. Users will be able to access documents generated by the
          Firstbase.io platform, connect with Firstbase.io partners that execute
          different services for users, and take advantage of perks and
          discounts within the Firstbase.io Network.

        <p>
          The Experts Subscription Service is offered to our Firstbase.io
          customers. It allows our users to find trusted legal counsel. Users
          will be able to access and review the profiles of attorneys, their
          practice areas, and other helpful information required in selecting
          legal counsel.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The services available on our Website may allow you to communicate
          with the attorneys we feature. By using the Website, you do not form
          an attorney/client relationship with the attorneys available via the
          Website. Any relationship between you and our attorneys must be
          governed under separate terms between you and the attorney. At no time
          do we review the content you communicate to the attorneys, and we
          advise you not to disclose confidential information, or seek legal
          advice, opinions or recommendations about your legal rights, via our
          Website. Firstbase.io is not a law firm and may not perform services
          performed by an attorney. Firstbase.io and its Website are not a

        <h2>Fees</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          In certain instances, we may charge a fee for use of the services
          available on our Website. You are responsible for any fees applicable
          to content that you post or other features, products, services or
          licenses you purchase or that are purchased through your account. You
          authorize us or our designated payment processor to charge your
          specified credit card, debit card or other payment method for such
          fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise specified, all fees are in United States dollars and
          all charges will be made in United States dollars. Any applicable
          sales or other taxes are additional to the stated fee. Currency
          exchange settlements and foreign transaction fees are based on your
          agreement with your credit card or other payment method provider.
        </p>

        <p>
          Except as required by law or otherwise stated on the site or in the
          services, all fees are nonrefundable and payments and purchases may
          not be canceled by the user. However, we reserve the right to refuse
          or terminate any purchase or attempted purchase at any time in our
          sole discretion.

        <h2>Money Back Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          We have incorporated thousands of businesses in the United States with
          the help of our award-winning customer support team guiding founders
          through the entire process. If there was a problem with the Services
          you received, please contact us at help.firstbase.io. A customer
          service representative will be happy to make every effort to resolve
          your issue. If we are not able to incorporate your business or if you
          choose to cancel an unfulfilled service within 7 days of purchase, we
          will refund back to you 100% of the Firstbase fees that you paid.
          Please note only Firstbase fees are refundable; all government, state,
          and third-party fees involved in your filing services are
          non-refundable to the extent they have already been paid on your
          behalf.
        </p>
        ‍
        <p>
          (a) What is the refund policy? ‍We stand by our services with a 7-day
          money back guarantee. Firstbase will issue a full refund within 7 days
          of purchase not including any state fees or third-party fees.
        </p>
        ‍
        <p>
          (b) When does it apply?
          <br />
          We can only refund our fee for issues we are directly responsible for
          or have control over. If you purchase something and later change your
          mind, we can't issue a refund. Below you can find the cases where
          refunds are applicable:
          <br />
          - Request before company registration has been filed (full refund
          possible if the registered agent has not yet submitted filing to the
          applicable state)
          <br />- Request after registration and before EIN has been applied for
          and/or IRS form SS4 has been faxed to IRS (partial refund of 50% of
          Firstbase fees paid)
        </p>
        ‍
        <p>
          (c) What can’t be refunded?
          <br />
          Once we submit any paperwork to the government on your behalf, we
          cannot refund any filing fees. In addition, if you purchase a product
          through us that is serviced by a third party (such as Firstbase
          MailroomTM, Firstbase AgentTM, etc.), we cannot refund fees paid to
          those providers.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Application for Incorporation</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The process of setting up a company may take longer than the estimated
          time if one of the parties involved (e.g., IRS, registered agent, or
          any other party) requires additional time to process the request.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2> 1. Services</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Description of Services</h3>
        <p>
          The Services consist of virtual mail services administered through
          Company’s proprietary platform (the “Platform”). The Services include
          certain services which are provided by third parties not affiliated
          with the Company, including but not limited to a third providing PDF
          to mail functionality and a third party agent located in Customer’s
          state of incorporation or domicile (the “Local Agent”), as designated
          and authorized by Customer pursuant to United States Postal Service
          Form 1583, titled “Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent”
          (“Form 1583”). As part of the Services, and subject to execution of
          Form 1583 by Customer, the Local Agent will:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Scan all hardcopy mail and upload into the Platform for receipt by
          the corresponding Customer
        </p>
        <p>
          - Forward mail to the Customer as requested (postage paid by Customer)
        </p>
        <p>
          - Recycle mail that is not actioned within 30 days. Requesting a mail
          action resets the 30 day window.
        </p>
        <p>- Shred uploaded mail upon Customer request; and</p>
        <p>
          - Notify Customers of received mail, forwarded mail status, and
          respond to Customer queries regarding mail received.
        </p>

        <p>
          All communications between the Local Agent and Customer will be
          through the Platform, and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
          Customer acknowledges and agrees that its access to and use of the
          Services may be affected by factors outside of Company’s control,
          including but not limited to actions and omissions of third parties
          and the requirements set forth by the Local Agent or other third
          parties, and Company will not be liable or bear any responsibility for
          such factors. Customer further acknowledges that the services by the
          Local Agent are limited and that (a) the Local Agent supports the
          receipt, forwarding, and other processing of only mail and not
          packages, (b) the Local Agent does not receive or otherwise process
          mail for individuals or entities other than the Customer, and any mail
          that is not labeled with the Customer’s company name will be rejected
          by the Local Agent, and (c) the Local Agent’s forwarding service may
          not be available to every Customer and will be subject to additional
          fees. As part of the Services, the Local Agent will assign a mailing
          address for Customer; however, such address may be changed and/or
          disabled, at the Local Agent or Company’s discretion, upon written
          notice to Customer. If disabled, Company or the Local Agent will use
          reasonable efforts to assign a new address to Customer.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          Customer will need to purchase a subscription to the Platform to
          access the Services. Customer may elect a subscription for a bundle of
          features (a “Mailroom Bundle”), which include Customer’s right to
          access the Services and may include other products or services that
          may be offered by the Company through the Platform. All subscription
          descriptions and pricing are set forth on the Ordering Page (as
          defined below). Customer’s subscription will renew automatically at
          the then-current rates for additional periods as set forth on the
          Ordering Page or if not specified thereon, then annual periods.
          Company reserves the right to change subscription prices at the end of
          each subscription term and will provide notice of the change on the
          Platform or in an email to Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          any fees payable to a state authority or other governmental authority
          is subject to change at any time, upon written notice. Customer’s
          continued use of the Services after the price change becomes effective
          constitutes Customer’s agreement to pay the changed amount upon
          renewal of your subscription and Customer will automatically be
          charged at the start of each new subscription period in accordance
          with Section 3. To avoid future subscription charges, Customer must
          submit to Company (a) proof of change of the Company’s mailing address
          and (b) written notice indicating Customer’s desire to cancel its
          subscription at least ten business days before the subscription period
          renewal date by contacting us by creating a ticket here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Subject to the foregoing period noted to avoid renewal charges,
          Customer may cancel at any time and will be permitted to access and
          use the Services for the remaining period in the then-effective
          subscription term. All subscription fees are non-refundable and no
          credits shall be given for any partially used periods.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 Subscription Changes</h3>
        <p>
          If Customer elects to change its subscription from a higher tier
          Mailroom Bundle to a lower tier Mailroom Bundle (“Downgrade”), such
          Downgrade, including the new fees and any loss of access to features
          and functionalities provided in the higher tier, will take effect at
          the start of the next subscription period. In order to Downgrade,
          Customers with mailing addresses in the states of New York,
          California, or Florida must submit to Company (a) proof of change of
          the Company’s mailing address and (b) written notice indicating
          Customer’s desire to cancel its subscription at least ten business
          days before the subscription period renewal date by creating a ticket
          here. No refunds or credits shall be given for any Downgrade. If
          Customer elects to change its subscription to a higher tier Mailroom
          Bundle or to any Mailroom Bundle that includes functionalities not
          included in Customer’s current subscription (“Upgrade”), Customer will
          be charged the difference in subscription fees required for the new
          Mailroom Bundle and such Upgrade will take effect following Customer’s
          payment. An Upgrade will trigger the commencement of a new
          subscription period and Customer’s subscription will automatically
          renew thereafter on the anniversary of the date such Upgrade was
          effective (or based on such other periods as set forth on the Ordering
          Page).
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Access to Services</h3>

          non-sublicenseable right to access and use the Platform to access
          Services and communicate with the Local Agent solely for the purposes
          hereof. Company will provide Customer with username(s) and password(s)
          pursuant to which Customer may access the Services. Customer will be
          responsible for any actions taken by parties with access to such
          usernames and passwords, and Customer agrees not to disclose such
          usernames and passwords to any third parties (other than employees of
          Customer).

          No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a
          result of this Agreement and a Party does not have any authority of
          any kind to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever. All
          notices under this Agreement will be in writing and sent to the
          recipient’s address set forth above and will be deemed to have been
          duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is
          electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; the
          day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized
          overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or
          registered mail, return receipt requested. Each Party will be excused
          from performance for any period during which, and to the extent that,
          it is prevented from performing any obligation or service, in whole or

          without its fault or negligence, including, but not limited to, acts
          of God, acts of war, epidemics, fire, communication line failures,

          will be entitled to injunctive relief in the event Customer uses the

          Services hereunder, and in connection therewith may be required to
          execute forms appointing its Registered Agent in the applicable
          state(s). Similarly, if Customer is a new customer to Company and/or
          otherwise has an existing entity that was not incorporated or formed

        <h3>1.4 Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          Customer will need to purchase a subscription to the Platform to
          access the Services. Customer may elect a subscription solely for the
          Services or a bundle of Platform features (“Agent Bundles”), which
          include Customer’s right to access the Services along with other
          products or services that may be offered by the Company through the
          Platform. All subscription descriptions and pricing are set forth on
          the Ordering Page (as defined below). Customer’s subscription will
          renew automatically at the then-current rates for additional periods
          as set forth on the Ordering Page or if not specified thereon, then
          annual periods. Company reserves the right to change subscription
          prices at the end of each subscription term and will provide notice of

          the foregoing, any fees payable to a state authority or other
          governmental authority is subject to change at any time, upon written
          notice. Customer’s continued use of the Services after the price
          change becomes effective constitutes Customer’s agreement to pay the
          changed amount upon renewal of your subscription and Customer will
          automatically be charged at the start of each new subscription period
          in accordance with Section 3. To avoid future subscription charges,
          Customer must submit to Company (a) proof of change of the Company’s
          Registered Agent and (b) written notice indicating Customer’s desire
          to cancel its subscription at least ten business days before the
          subscription period renewal date by emailing support@firstbase.io.
          Subject to the foregoing period noted to avoid renewal charges,
          Customer may cancel at any time and will be permitted to access and
          use the Services for the remaining period in the then-effective
          subscription term. All subscription fees are non-refundable and no
          credits shall be given for any partially used periods.

          including the new fees and any loss of access to features and
          functionalities provided in the higher tier, will take effect at the
          start of the next subscription period. No refunds or credits shall be
          given for any Downgrade. If Customer elects to change its subscription
          to a higher tier Agent Bundle or to any Agent Bundle that includes
          functionalities not included in Customer’s current subscription
          (“Upgrade”), Customer will be charged the difference in subscription
          fees required for the new Agent Bundle and such Upgrade will take
          effect following Customer’s payment. An Upgrade will trigger the
          commencement of a new subscription period and Customer’s subscription
          will automatically renew thereafter on the anniversary of the date
          such Upgrade was effective (or based on such other periods as set
          forth on the Ordering Page).

          provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
          that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
          necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force
          and effect and enforceable. Neither Party may assign this Agreement
          without the other Party’s prior written consent; provided, that,
          either Party may assign this Agreement without such consent to an
          affiliate or to a successor to all or substantially all of the
          business or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by sale of
          stock, sale of assets, merger, reorganization or otherwise. Any
          assignment or attempted assignment by either Party in violation of the

          Agreement will be binding on the Parties and their successors and
          assigns. Both Parties agree that this Agreement, together with the

          partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of
          this Agreement and each Party does not have any authority of any kind
          to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever. All notices under
          this Agreement will be in writing and sent, if to Company, to the
          address set forth in Section 13 below and if to Customer, to the
          address associated with Customer’s Account and will be deemed to have
          been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt
          is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; the
          day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized
          overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or
          registered mail, return receipt requested. Each Party will be excused
          from performance (other than performance of payment obligations) for
          any period during which, and to the extent that, it is prevented from

Customer’s continued use of the Services after any such changes or modifications become effective constitutes acceptance of such changes or modifications.  Each of Company and Customer may be referred to herein individually as a “Party” or collectively as “Parties”.  Customer’s use of the Services shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and all other terms, agreements and policies referenced herein and Customer agrees that its Acceptance hereunder shall also constitute its acceptance of such other terms, agreements and policies.</p>

Customer’s subscription will renew automatically at the then-current rates for additional periods as set forth on the Ordering Page or if not specified thereon.  Company reserves the right to change subscription prices at the end of each subscription term and will provide notice of the change on the Platform or in an email to Customer.
